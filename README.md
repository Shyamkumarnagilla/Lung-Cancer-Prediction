# Lung Cancer Prediction
 
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting lung cancer using patient data. The goal is to develop models that can assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis, ultimately improving patient outcomes.<br>

Dataset<br>
The dataset used in this project includes patient demographics, medical history, and other relevant factors. The data was preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and prepare it for model training.<br>
